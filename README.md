Usage:
1. Generate data using the combatsim.py and entering the desired amount of data (simulated games) in the terminal (10k lines of data is already included in the results.csv file).
2. Retrain the model if needed by running the combatsimModel.py and entering anything but 'n' into the console (A trained model is already stored in the combatsimModel.pth file).
3. Manually test the model by entering 'y' after the training has been completed.
